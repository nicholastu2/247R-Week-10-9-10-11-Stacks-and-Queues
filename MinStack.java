//2. Min Stack: Write a MinStack class that has a getMin() (in O(1) time) function that returns the minimum value in the stack, as well as all other operations associated with a stack. Note: the getMin() function does not have to extract the min, just say what it is. All operations must work in constant (O(1)) runtime. (Try to do this without using more than one stack) - If this one is difficult, skip it and come back to it later
